var rotateString = function(s, goal) {
    if (s.length !== goal.length) {
        return false; // If the lengths are different, s can't be a rotation of goal
    }
    const doubleS = s + s;

    if (doubleS.includes(goal)) {
        return true;
    }

    return false;

};

Approach:

we string with itself then check if it includes the goal string or not with help of includes function.

------Sample example:

s=abcde
goal=cdeab
s+s=abcdecdeab
then clearly s+s includes the goal which means if we perform some rotations then it would be similar to gaol.

---------cosider another example:

Input: s = "abcde", goal = "abced"
Output: false
because order of abced is not perserved when you perform rotations see,s:
rot#1:      rot#2:    rot#3    rot#4     rot#5
eabcd       deabc     cdeab    bcdea     abcde
s+s=abcdeabcde which clearly not including the goal.
