var lengthOfLongestSubstring = function(s) {
  
  let count=0;
  let i=0;
  let j=0;
  let max=0;
  let set=new Set();
 while(j<s.length){
      if(!set.has(s[j])){
          set.add(s[j]);
          count++;
          j++;
          max=Math.max(max,j-i)
      }else{
          set.delete(s[i]);
          i++;
      }
  }      
          
     return max;   
    
};

Approach:

i is set to be the first position at set where elements add up and if next element is equal to the prev element then that element is 
removed which is placed at i and i is moved on .
