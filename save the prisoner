function saveThePrisoner(n, m, s) {
    // Write your code here
 const remainder = (m - 1) % n;
  // Calculate the position of the last prisoner to receive a candy
    let lastPrisoner = (s - 1 + remainder) % n;

    // Add 1 to convert from 0-based indexing to 1-based indexing
    lastPrisoner = (lastPrisoner + 1);

    return lastPrisoner;
}

-----Sample expample-------

n=4
m=6
s=2

there are n=4 prisoners in which we have to distribute m=6 candies which are seated on 4 chairs if we start distributing from chair s=2 then who will get the awful candy:

dry run:
remainder=6-1=5 .... 5%4 .....1
lasteprisoner=6-1=5+1 6%4........1
now add 1 to lastprisoner......1+1 ==2 our answer;
